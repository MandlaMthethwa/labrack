     <h1>About Us</h1>
     <p style="padding-left:30px;padding-right:30px;">Sc lab track deals with the maintenance of the student's attendance 
		details. It will generate a weekly report of the student's attendance based on their 
		presence in class. Only if the student is present on that particular period will the 
		system calculate the number of hours the student has attended. This system aims to reduce the paper work and saving time by generating accurate results from the 
		student's attendance, avoid redundant data and mitigate the issue of students 
		signing in for each other. Efficient reports cannot be generated if attendance is 
		maintained manually. Instead as the attendances are maintained in registers it has 
		been a tough task for admin and staff to maintain for long time. the software can keep long and retrieve the information when needed.
